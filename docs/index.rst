Welcome to SNDAQ's documentation!
=================================

The Supernova DAQ (SNDAQ), is the online pulse-counting software used to search
for ~1 s bursts of MeV neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae and other
luminous transients. A selection of references describing the software and its
use in IceCube can be found here:
